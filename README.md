#Drop

Drop is a platform that runs small "plugin" applications. It can be used for
internal tooling or as a simple collection of JS-powered applications (JS on 
the client and Node.js on the server).

To install:

```
$ npm install
$ node app
```

The app should be running on http://localhost:4000

## Creating a plugin

_(note that right now only cient-side plugins are supported)_

```
# Look at how /app/plugins/todos does it. Then duplicate that folder and remove all of it.
```
